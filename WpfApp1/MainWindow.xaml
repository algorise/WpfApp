    <!-- Fundamentals -->
    <!--  Overview 
            In markup the window element must include the x:Class atrribute. it is necessary because when it app is build, the existence
             x:Class attribute causes the MSbuild engine to generate a partial class that derives from the window with the name that is specified by the x:Class attribute.
             This requires the addition of an XML namespaces declaration for xaml schema:
             xmlns:x=http..xaml
             This partial class implements the InializeComponent method, which is called to register the events and set the properties that are implemented in markup.
            
            - the name of partial class is the same as specified by x:Class attribute in markup and it must derive from Window. This is done so to associate the code behind the file with the partial class generated for markup file
            - In the code behind, the Window class must implement a constructor that calls the InitializeComponent method. This method is implemented by the markup file's generated partial class to register events and set the properties that are defined in the markup.
